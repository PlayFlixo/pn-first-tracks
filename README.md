## About

Flixo is a project for unblocked games designed for River Falls, WI high school students. However, V2 is still in beta, and will be fully released in 03.01.2024.

## Differences

- In V1, Project Neutron was built to open each link inside of Project Neutron.
- In V2, Project Neutron is designed to open each link in a new tab in about:blank cloaking. This prevents a mass amount of links from being seen in your history, keeping it on the down-low, as well as easier support for applications such as google sites in case of a block.
